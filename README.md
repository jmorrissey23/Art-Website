# Art-Website

This was my first experience with web design and was a great learning experience. I decided to develop an art website for my mom to be able to showcase and potentially sell her art. If I was to do it all again, I would have used a framework like React and incorporated more JavaScript into the project. I also would have developed it for mobile first and then scaled it for other devices. 

The website can be accessed by copying and pasting "jmorrissey23.github.io" into the search bar.
